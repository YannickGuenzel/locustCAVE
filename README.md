# locustCAVE
## Cave automatic virtual environment (CAVE) for tethered-walking animals.
This repository contains code for an immersive virtual reality environment. The cave consists of three high-speed gaming monitors (144fps) positioned in the front and to the sides of a track-ball system.
For closed-loop behavioural experiments with tethered-walking animals, the fictive path is reconstructed using FicTrac (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneumeth.2014.01.010">Moore et al., 2014</a>).
I construct the virtual environment with the Python-based gaming engine <a href="https://www.panda3d.org/">Panda3D</a>.

Note that this is still work in progress and was only tested under Windows 10 with Python 3.10 and Panda3D 1.10.11.
